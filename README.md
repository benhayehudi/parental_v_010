Parental is a Ruby on Rails todo application for parents and caregivers to organize the items they need to get done. Users can create accounts, either through a registration page or by signing in through Facebook. Once registered, users are able to create TODO lists and add specific Tasks to each TODO list. Both a TODO list and a specific Task can be marked "done" and can be shared via email or social media with others.
